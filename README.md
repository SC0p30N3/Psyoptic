# Psyoptic

A shell script to link the output of some of my favorite security scanning tools. 
This tool features both active and passive scanning.  
TRY THIS AT HOME!... 
And never against networks you do not have absolute permission to do so on. 
As always, I am 100% not responsible for how you use this script, and express no warranty.

All tools are cred to their amazing orignal authors
Written to be run from Kali install with minimal outside dependencies.


Requires
  /bin/bash (Duh) AND whatever the tools dependencies are.
  Look... You're grown now, internet people, I can't hold your hand no moe.
